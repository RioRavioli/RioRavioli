a. problem 1: about 5 hours
	problem 2: about 3 hours
	problem 3: about 6 hours

b. I could have read the specification test details before starting, because I had to make many adjustments
to make it compatible. 

c. You could have made it more clear what is expected of the program, so we did not have to make many implmentation
changes for the specification tests.

d. I wish I knew how much checkRep() could potentially slow the program down, as I spent significant time looking
through my algorithm for things that could cause slow down.
