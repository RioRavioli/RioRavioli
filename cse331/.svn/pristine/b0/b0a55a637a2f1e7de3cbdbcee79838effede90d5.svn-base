a. I did not add any additional checkReps because the only place that requires it is the constructor,
	and it is already in there. It is not needed anywhere else becaues RatTerm is immutable. 

b. The constructor can just store the given arguments as is, and therefor would be less complex. For
	toString, the case where the coefficient is zero, and exponent is larger than one must still print
	0.

c. The only thing that should change is the constuctor, because once again RatTerm is immuatble. The
	constuctor would just have to store the fields following the new guide lines. All implementations
	should still follow the specs, because this is a stricter implementation of the spec. I prefer
	the original implementation because it gives more freedom in the implementation.
