# Tests adding several nodes to the graph.
# Tests adding several edges to the graph.

created graph graph
added node n1 to graph
added node n2 to graph
added node n3 to graph
graph contains: n1 n2 n3
added edge edge1 from n2 to n2 in graph
added edge edge2 from n2 to n1 in graph
added edge edge2 from n1 to n1 in graph
the children of n2 in graph are: n2(edge1) n1(edge2)
