a.
r = p - q
		set r = q by making a term-by-term copy of all terms in q to r
		foreach term, t_p, in p:
				if any term, t_r, in r has the same degree as t_p,
						then replace t_r in r with the result of t_p minus t_r
						else insert t_p into r as a new term

b.
r = p * q
		set r = 0
		foreach term, t_p, in p:
				foreach term, t_q, in q:
						multiply t_p with t_q
						add result to r

c.
We claim the loop invariant:
	p*q[d..] + r = p * q

precondition => LI
	The loop precondition is r = 0. The loop invariant holds.

{LI && t_p exists} body {LI}
	This is a foreach loop, so t_p exists.
	p and q are not modified in loop, and thus we can state:
		{p*q[d_pre..] + r_pre = p + q} body {p*r[d_post] + r_post = p + q}

	Another loop invariant for inner foreach:
		The same as first one, because no changes are made in between the two loops. 
	
	{LI && t_q exists} body {LI}
		This is a foreach loop, so t_r exists.
		
		By foward reasoning, r_post = r_pre + t_p*t_r
		The inner loop body postcondition is r_post = r_pre + t_p*t_r. Since
		p*r[d_post..] = p*q[d_pre..] - t_p*t_r, the loop invariant holds.

	Because there is no change from the end of the inner loop to the end of the outer
	loop, the postcondition is the same. Because the LI are the same for both loops
	and the postcondition satified the inner loop, it also shows that the LI for the
	outer loop holds.

LI => postcondition
	Because d-1 is the maximum degree in p*q, p[d..] = "0" and the postcondition,
	r = p * q, holds.
