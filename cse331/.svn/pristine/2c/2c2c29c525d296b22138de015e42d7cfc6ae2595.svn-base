# Sample testing file
# Tests graph creation/viewing and path finding with a
# simple graph ('A') with three nodes.  Also tests
# that the simultaneous creation of another graph
# ('B') does not result in incorrect behavior.

created graph A
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A
created graph B
B contains:
added node n3 to A
added edge e31 from n3 to n1 in A
added node n1 to B
added node n2 to B
added edge e21 from n2 to n1 in B
added edge e13 from n1 to n3 in A
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in A
A contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in A are: n2(e12) n3(e13)
added edge e33 from n3 to n3 in A
the children of n3 in A are: n1(e31) n3(e33)
