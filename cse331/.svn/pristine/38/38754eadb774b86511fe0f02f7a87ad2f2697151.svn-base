a. Both check for the denominator to be greater than or equal to 0. But one difference is that daikon
	does not require the invariants to represent the reduced form.

b. The small test requires this.denominator to be at least one, while the normal test has no requirement.
	The normal test requires arg to have a numerator of at least -1. The small test has no requirement.
	The small test requires arg's denominator to be at least one, while the normal test requires at least 0.
	These differences show that the reduced test does not test the cases where the denominator is 0. In
	otherwords, it does not test for NaN values.
