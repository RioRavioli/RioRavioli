a. It failed this case because it was throwing the exception for 0 too, even though 0 is nonnegative. Change the condition for the excption so it's strictly less than 0.

b. It failed this case becasue the base case requires the first value of 0. This originally casued an exception, but was fixed along with the exception check.

c. It failed this case because for index 2, 1 was also returned where it should continue to do recursion. Change so return one when strictly less than 2.
