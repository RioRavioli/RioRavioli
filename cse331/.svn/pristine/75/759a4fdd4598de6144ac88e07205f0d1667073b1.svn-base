b. I could have used the junit tests as I write the methods rather than after writing all methods for
	a class.

c. Some things could have been more clearly explained. Some of the specs for the private methods for
	RatPoly took a long time to understand, though it turned out to be very simple in the end.

d. I wish I had a better understanding of polynomial division before I started, as I spent quite a while
	reunderstand it even though it was covered in homework 3 part 0.
