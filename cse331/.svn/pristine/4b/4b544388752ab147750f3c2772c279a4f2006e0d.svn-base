a. Ball needed a this.volume = volume, so that the field would get set properly.

b. It would be better to keep track of the total volume, so then you do not have to iterate through the whole loop just to get this value.

c. You could put the elements of the iterators into a list, sort it, then create a new iterator. You could also return an iterator that
gives the next smallest value as it computes next(). The first is probably better because you do not have to make heavy computations everytime you go through the iterator.
