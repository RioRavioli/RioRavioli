# Test breadth-first search algorithm without parser.
# Note that in this graph, there is an edge from GORILLA-MAN to HAWK but not
# vice versa. In your full parser-generated Marvel graph, relationships are
# bidirectional meaning an edge from A to B will always be accompanied by an
# edge from B to A.
