My representation of the graph is a map which maps the name of a node to a Node object.
This allows the nodes to be unique, and also for quick access to the Node object. 
	The adantage of a collection of edges is that it makes it easy to directly manipulate edges,
without having to deal with nodes in between. An adjacency list is useful for keeping nodes
and their edges organized well. An adjacency matrix is a good way to quickly access edges or
to see if they exist. My representation is advantageous for quick access time and good
organization of nodes.
