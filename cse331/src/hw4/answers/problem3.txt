First, the important thing is to test every method, so tests for each method were sure to be
written. For the test cases, I start by writing very simple test cases to make sure the graph
works with small amounts of data, such as one node. Then I slowly increase the complexity,
as I also start to include usage of other methods. 
	I try to think of certain orders the methods could potentially be called when thinking of
complex test cases. Because some of the more complex tests require multiple methods, it is a
good chance to check multiple methods, to make sure they are all functioning properly.

After working on the implementation, a few tests were changed around. Mainly, I realized a
new test case would be important in order to check whether an edges that needs to be deleted
gets properly deleted under spcefic circumstances.
