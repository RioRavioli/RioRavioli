If `object` does not have the expected \ndestructor method, then an exception is thrown when `ensure()` is called.\n"}], ["markdown", "\n\n"], ["api-json", {"line_number": 33, "name": "when", "params": [{"datatype": "function", "line_number": 37, "required": true, "name": "callback", "description": "A function that will be called when `send()` is called.
