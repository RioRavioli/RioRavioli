# FRUSDL - Ffi RUby SDL bindings - README #
###########################################
 
 
What is it?
===========
Wafer-thin bindings to SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer, SDL_gfx, and 
SGE for MRI, Jruby, Rubinius, ... using FFI. You will be able to easily port 
your Ruby/SDL games to JRuby.  

For now, only a  few high-level, Ruby/SDL compatible objects are available. 
But the low level wrappers should work fine for experimenting, or even to program a 
quick demo game. 

Goal 
=====

Source code compatibility with Ruby/SDL 2.0.1 or higher, but with lower level 
functions available. All help for towards this goal is welcome. 
 
Version 
=======

  0.0.1

Requirements
============ 
 * Ruby: MRI 1.9.1 or higher, JRuby 1.1.6 or higher. Rubinius currently untested.
 * FFI: Version 0.2.0 or higher or MRI. 
 * The shared libraries for SDL 1.2.x, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer, SDL_gfx 
   or SGE should be installed properly on your system.
   
Documentation
=============
   
None yet. Check out the documentation of SDL itself, since the 
low level interface to sdl in Frusdl::Low should be mostly compatible with 
the C way of doing things, if you include Frusdl::Low. Alternatively, 
use the source, Ruke. ^_^  

License 
=======

ZLIB license. Please note that SDL has a LGPL license. However, FRUSDL
uses dynamic linking, so , I think it should be fine.
