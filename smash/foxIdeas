Uthrow onto top platform. If they don't tech, crouch cancel, then punish accordingly. See how effective the CC is.

Uthrow uair Puff, hit uair really early and try to hit with only second hit.

Fthrow Marth off stage, do dash dance or CC to avoid fair, then shine. 

When falco goes for laser -> fsmash while you're in the air, maybe smash di the laser and do an attack right away like shine?
		Originally the idea is Marth could probably di away and upB after the laser, before the fsmash.

When on platform, and attack from below is fierce (like marth's under platform), then light sheild -> sheid drop -> aerial.

Do Marth killer, forcing the opponent to land on stage. Then do an uair and hit with second hit while they are in landing lag, or
	bair if they are at high percent and repeat.
